PROJECT: Evaluating Anomaly Detection Methods for Multivariative Time Series

### Team 
Mary McCready, Pranavi Addagatla, Rohith Krishna Papani, Rahulrajan Karthikeyan, Shawn Mian, Nikhil Bodela

## Project Intent
We aim to investigate multiple ML related approaches to anomaly detection and  use our finding to develop anomaly detection techniques using a variety of tested approaches

## Problem Definition
Rising data volume across the computing world calls for a greater need for reliable anomaly detection systems and anomalous data may signal critical incidents or highlight data errors and accurately identifying these issues can lead prevent critical errors and improved data set representations.
